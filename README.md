# Cyber-security-Intern-First-Task-ElevateLabs
Cybersecurity Internship Task 1: Understanding CIA Triad, Attack Surfaces, OWASP Top 10, and Common Attack Vectors. Foundational learning covering confidentiality, integrity, availability, threat actors, and web application vulnerabilities.

# Task Overview
So basically I had to cover:
- The CIA Triad thing (not the spy agency lol) with examples I could relate to
- Where attackers usually target systems
- Different types of hackers and why they do what they do
- OWASP Top 10 vulnarabilities (this was interesting)
- looking at how data moves and where it can get attacked

# What I actutally learned 
### The CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Basically keeping your stuff private from people who shouldn't see it
- **Intergrity**: Making sure nobody messes with your data
- **Availability**: Keeping everthing up and running when you need it

### How I mapped Attack Surfaces
Phone/Laptop --> Website --> API --> Server --> Database
(Phishing emails)  (XSS)   (Broken APIs)  (Remote Code)  (SQL Injection)

## What I used 
- Browser for looking stuff up
- OWASP website (super helpful btw)
- Draw.io for making diagrams
